;;; Created: 2011-11-02
;;; Version: 0.9.2
;;; Keywords: games vimgolf vim

;; This file is not part of GNU Emacs

;;; Commentary:

;; This is a simple package that allows Emacs users to compete on [VimGolf][1]
;; using the One True Editor. Competition can be commenced utilizing `M-x
;; vimgolf`. When finished with a challenge, `C-c C-v C-c` should finish your
;; editing, ensure correctness, and submit your score and keystrokes to
;; [VimGolf][1].
;;
;; On second thought, let's not go to Camelot. It's a silly place.
;;
;; Patches are accepted at https://github.com/timvisher/vimgolf
;;
;; [1]: http://vimgolf.com/

;;; Installation:

;; Use package.el. You'll need to add Marmalade to your archives:

;; (require 'package)
;; (add-to-list 'package-archives
;;              '("marmalade" . "http://marmalade-repo.org/packages/"))

;; If you use a version of Emacs prior to 24 that doesn't include
;; package.el, you can get it from http://bit.ly/pkg-el23. If you have
;; an older package.el installed from tromey.com, you should upgrade
;; in order to support installation from multiple sources.
